# Tetris Multiplayer Game

This tetris multiplayer game allows for players to create rooms and have 2 or more players to join the game session by simply just sharing their room session ID in their browser.

# How to Use

1. Install node
2. Run this in your terminal `node server/main.js`
3. Afterwards proceed to open the `index.html` file in your browser.
4. If you would like to invite other players to play with you, simply copy browser's link with the session ID at the end e.g. file:///home/michael/tetris/index.html#k0p57f (Optional).
5. Enjoy :)

## TODO

Features to add:

-   Pausing the game and a pause menu.
-   A timer to record amount of time that has passed during gameplay.
-   A highscore board.
-   Background image.
-   Background music that can be disabled (too annoying).
